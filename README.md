# Universal Weapon Sway
Current version: Beta 2

Tested on GZDoom 4.3.3

## What does this mod do?
This mod adds momentum-based weapon sway to any weapon the player currently has out. This doesn't require replacing any weapons or the player themselves so it can be freely used with other mods that contain their own weapons/players. It can also be used on any Doom engine game including Heretic and Hexen. No load order is enforced so you can put this anywhere in your list. Also included are a plethora of options to tweak the sway to your desire.

## How do I install this?
No installation is necessary. If you want the latest stable version, on the main repo page make sure the branch is set to `master` and click on `Clone or download`. Click `Download ZIP` and you should now have the file. From here you can either drag and drop the ZIP file onto your GZDoom executable/shortcut to run it or use a mod manager. Alternatively you can set GZDoom to autoload it if you plan on always using it.

## Current potential issues
- While this mod should work fine with GZDoom's multiplayer, it has not been tested
- Weapon offsets may not always reset correctly
